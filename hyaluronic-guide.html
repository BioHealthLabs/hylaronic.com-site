      <h1>Hyaluronic Acid Guide: How to Get Plump, Hydrated Skin Without the Sticky Mess</h1>

      <p>
        Hyaluronic acid (HA) is one of the most hyped ingredients in skincare – and for once, the hype
        is mostly deserved. Used correctly, it can make your skin look smoother, bouncier and more
        hydrated. Used badly, it can actually make dryness worse.
      </p>

      <h2>What is hyaluronic acid?</h2>
      <p>
        Hyaluronic acid is a molecule that naturally exists in your skin, eyes and joints. It can bind
        up to 1,000 times its own weight in water and plays a key role in keeping your skin plump and
        cushioned.
      </p>
      <p>
        In skincare, “hyaluronic acid” usually refers to different forms of HA used in serums,
        essences and creams to increase surface hydration and improve skin feel.
      </p>

      <h2>What does hyaluronic acid actually do?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Boosts surface hydration:</strong> helps skin look smoother and more dewy.</li>
        <li><strong>Softens fine lines (temporarily):</strong> by plumping up the top layers of the skin.</li>
        <li><strong>Improves product feel:</strong> gives serums that “bouncy”, gel-like texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Supports barrier function:</strong> hydrated skin usually tolerates actives better.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Who should use hyaluronic acid?</h2>
      <p>
        Almost everyone can benefit from well-formulated hyaluronic products:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dry or dehydrated skin:</strong> extra hydration between cleanser and moisturiser.</li>
        <li><strong>Oily skin:</strong> lightweight hydration without heavy creams.</li>
        <li><strong>Retinol and acid users:</strong> helps offset some of the dryness from actives.</li>
        <li><strong>Air-conditioned or heated environments:</strong> where skin loses water faster.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to use hyaluronic acid correctly</h2>
      <p>
        This is where most people go wrong. Hyaluronic acid serums are not meant to replace your
        moisturiser or sunscreen – they sit in between.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Cleanse with a gentle, non-stripping cleanser.</li>
        <li>On slightly damp skin, apply a few drops of your hyaluronic serum.</li>
        <li>Follow with a moisturiser to “seal in” the hydration.</li>
        <li>Use sunscreen (SPF 30+) every morning as usual.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        If you apply hyaluronic acid on bone-dry skin and skip moisturiser on top, it can feel tight
        and paradoxically more dry.
      </p>

      <h2>Common forms of hyaluronic acid</h2>
      <p>
        When you read the ingredient list, you might see different names:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sodium hyaluronate:</strong> the most common, salt form of hyaluronic acid.</li>
        <li><strong>Hydrolysed hyaluronic acid:</strong> smaller fragments designed to penetrate a bit deeper.</li>
        <li><strong>Sodium acetylated hyaluronate:</strong> modified form claimed to cling better to the skin.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Many modern serums combine several molecular weights to target different layers of the skin
        surface – more on that in our
        <a href="/strong-hyaluronic-guide.html">advanced hyaluronic guide</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>How often can you use hyaluronic acid?</h2>
      <p>
        Unlike strong actives such as retinoids or exfoliating acids, hyaluronic acid is typically safe
        to use <strong>once or twice daily</strong> for most people.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a product feels sticky, pills under makeup or causes breakouts, the issue is usually the
        overall formula (thickeners, film-formers, fragrance) – not the hyaluronic acid itself.
      </p>

      <h2>Biggest mistakes people make with hyaluronic acid</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Using it without moisturiser:</strong> HA needs something occlusive on top.</li>
        <li><strong>Applying way too much:</strong> a thin layer is enough – more just feels tacky.</li>
        <li><strong>Layering 3–4 HA products:</strong> redundant and can lead to sticky buildup.</li>
        <li><strong>Expecting it to “fix” wrinkles:</strong> it hydrates, it doesn’t replace retinoids or SPF.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Can you combine hyaluronic acid with other actives?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes. In fact, hyaluronic acid plays well with almost everything:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>With vitamin C:</strong> HA after your vitamin C serum can help reduce dryness.</li>
        <li><strong>With retinol:</strong> supports hydration in a routine that might otherwise be drying.</li>
        <li><strong>With niacinamide:</strong> soothing, barrier-friendly combination.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The key is still to avoid overloading your routine. A simple routine used consistently beats
        a 12-step routine used twice a month.
      </p>

      <h2>How to choose a good hyaluronic serum</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Look for fragrance-free formulas if you have sensitive skin.</li>
        <li>Prioritise serums that combine HA with other hydrating ingredients (glycerin, urea, panthenol).</li>
        <li>Avoid very heavy, sticky gels if you’re oily and acne-prone.</li>
        <li>Don’t overpay just for “fancy water” – mid-priced serums can work extremely well.</li>
      </ul>
