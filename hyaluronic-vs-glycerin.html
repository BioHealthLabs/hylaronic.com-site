      <h1>Hyaluronic Acid vs Glycerin</h1>
      <p>
        Hyaluronic acid and glycerin are both humectants – ingredients that attract water into the skin.
        They’re often talked about as competitors, but in reality they work best together.
      </p>

      <h2>How they work in the skin</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hyaluronic acid</strong> can hold many times its weight in water and sits mainly on the surface.</li>
        <li><strong>Glycerin</strong> is a smaller molecule that can draw water into the upper layers of the skin.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In simple terms: hyaluronic acid feels more “plumping” on the surface, while glycerin gives deep, flexible hydration.
      </p>

      <h2>Which one is more hydrating?</h2>
      <p>
        On paper, hyaluronic acid sounds stronger because of its famous “1000x its weight in water” claim.
        In real routines, glycerin is just as important – and often more reliable in very dry climates.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s why many of the best serums and moisturisers use <em>both</em> ingredients together instead of choosing just one.
      </p>

      <h2>Which one is better for sensitive skin?</h2>
      <p>
        Both are generally well-tolerated, even by sensitive skin. Problems usually come from the overall formula:
        fragrance, alcohol or too many actives layered on top.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your skin is reactive, look for simple formulas with hyaluronic acid and glycerin plus soothing ingredients
        like panthenol or allantoin – and minimal extras.
      </p>

      <h2>When to focus on one over the other</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Very tight, dehydrated skin:</strong> look for serums and creams combining hyaluronic acid + glycerin.</li>
        <li><strong>Oily but dehydrated:</strong> lightweight glycerin-based products can feel less sticky.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer-heavy routines:</strong> a single good serum containing both is often better than stacking many products.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you’re still unsure, think of it this way: hyaluronic acid gives you that immediate, plump feel on the surface.
        Glycerin quietly keeps the hydration going in the background – and the best formulas use both.
